        16.3 Severance.

    </b> </p>
<p> (a) If any provision or part-provision of the Contract is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be
    deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not
    possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a
    provision or part-provision under this clause shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of the
    Contract.
</p>
<p> (b) If [one party gives notice to the other of the possibility that] any provision or part-provision of this
    Contract is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend such provision so
    that, as amended, it is legal, valid and enforceable, and, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the intended
    commercial result of the original provision.
</p>
<p><b>16.4</b> Waiver. A waiver of any right under the Contract or law is only effective if it is in writing and shall
    not be
    deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right or
    remedy under the Contract or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor prevent or
    restrict its further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or
    remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
</p>
<p><b>16.5</b> No partnership or agency. Nothing in the Contract is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any
    partnership or joint venture between any of the parties, nor constitute either party the agent of another party for
    any purpose. Neither party shall have authority to act as agent for, or to bind, the other party in any way.
</p>
<p><b>16.6</b> Third parties. A person who is not a party to the Contract shall not have any rights to enforce its
    terms.
</p>
